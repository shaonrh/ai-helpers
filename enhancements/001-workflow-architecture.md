| **Dependencies** | [#3](https://github.com/quay/ai-helpers/pull/3) (Konflux plugin), [#4](https://github.com/quay/ai-helpers/pull/4) (Lola support), [RedHatProductSecurity/lola](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola) |

## Summary

Move Ambient Code Platform (ACP) workflow definitions into `quay/ai-helpers`
alongside the existing plugins. Use [Lola](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola)
to compose reusable plugins into per-project workflows. Project-specific
documentation (AGENTS.md, agent_docs/) stays in each source repo.

## Motivation

The quay/quay repo carries a `.claude/` directory with 11 skills, 17 scripts,
8 commands, and project-specific hooks. An audit shows:

| Category | From ai-helpers | Quay-specific | Customized copies |
|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Skills | 8 | 2 | 6 of the 8 |
| Scripts | 13 | 3 | 6 of the 13 |
| Commands | 8 | 0 | 0 |

Most "customizations" are just hardcoded values where ai-helpers uses env vars
(JIRA domain, project keys, PR title regex, default repo). The actual logic is
identical.

**Problems this creates:**

1. **No update path.** Bug fixes and improvements to ai-helpers plugins don't
   reach quay. Manual re-copy is error-prone and nobody does it.

2. **Drift.** The quay copies diverge from ai-helpers over time. Six of eight
   shared skills have drifted — mostly by hardcoding values that should be
   env vars.

3. **Coupling.** Agent infrastructure (`.claude/`) is mixed into the
   application repo. It's not part of the product and creates noise in PRs,
   reviews, and CI.

4. **Onboarding friction.** Adding workflows for clair, quay-operator, or
   quay-builder means duplicating the entire `.claude/` setup.

## Why Lola

We evaluated two AI package managers:
[Lola](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola) (Red Hat) and
[APM](https://github.com/microsoft/apm) (Microsoft).

APM has stronger features (lock file, native hook integration, security
scanning), but requires restructuring the plugin layout — scripts must move
to `hooks/scripts/`, commands must be renamed to `.prompt.md` format. This
**breaks compatibility with Claude's native plugin system** (`claude plugin
add`). Plugins could no longer be installed both ways.

Lola was selected because it preserves the existing plugin layout:

1. **Plugin compatibility.** Lola adds a single `lola.yaml` file alongside
   the existing `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `skills/`, `scripts/`, and
   `commands/` directories. The plugins remain fully compatible with
   `claude plugin add` for teams that don't use ACP workflows.

2. **Red Hat alignment.** Lola is built by Red Hat Product Security. We get
   internal support channels and influence over the roadmap.

3. **Already integrated.** PR #4 adds Lola support to all four plugins with
   `lola.yaml` manifests and a shared post-install hook. The work is done.

4. **Simple model.** `.lola-req` is a flat list of module paths/URLs.
   `lola sync` installs them. Post-install hooks copy scripts and templates
   to `.claude/`. No compilation step, no manifest schema.

**Tradeoffs accepted:**

- No lock file — sessions get whatever the current branch points at. Pin
  via git tags in `.lola-req` URLs if reproducibility is needed.
- Scripts and commands are deployed via post-install hooks, not natively.
  This is handled by the shared `scripts/lola-post-install.sh`.
- Requires Python 3.13 — available via `uvx --python 3.13 --from lola-ai lola`.

### Dual Distribution Model

Each plugin supports two installation paths:

| Method | Command | Who uses it |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Claude native | `claude plugin add quay/ai-helpers --path plugins/dev` | Individual developers |
| Lola (via ACP) | `lola sync` (reads `.lola-req`) | ACP workflow sessions |

The same plugin directory serves both. Lola adds `lola.yaml` alongside
`plugin.json` — they don't conflict.

### Plugin Composition

`workflows/quay/.lola-req`:

```
# Plugins installed at session start via lola sync
https://github.com/quay/ai-helpers.git --module-content=plugins/dev
https://github.com/quay/ai-helpers.git --module-content=plugins/jira-planning
https://github.com/quay/ai-helpers.git --module-content=plugins/openshift-testing
https://github.com/quay/ai-helpers.git --module-content=plugins/konflux
```

Git URLs with `--module-content` are required because ACP's `hydrate.sh`
extracts only the workflow subpath — relative paths like `../../plugins/dev`
won't resolve at runtime (see [Resolved Questions](#resolved-questions)).

`lola sync` reads this file, installs SKILL.md files to `.claude/skills/`,
and runs the post-install hook which copies scripts, templates, and commands
to their expected `.claude/` locations.

### Post-Install Hook

Each plugin's `lola.yaml` declares a post-install hook:

```yaml
hooks:
  post-install: scripts/lola-post-install.sh
```

The hook script (symlinked from `scripts/lola-post-install.sh` in the repo
root) receives `LOLA_MODULE_PATH` and `LOLA_PROJECT_PATH` env vars and copies:

- `scripts/*.sh` → `.claude/scripts/` (with `chmod +x`)
- `templates/*` → `.claude/templates/`
- `commands/*.md` → `.claude/commands/`

### Bootstrap Script

`session-setup.sh` is the entry point for all workflows. It runs as a
`SessionStart` hook, installs plugins via Lola, and performs standard
bootstrap (pre-commit, gh auth, etc.).

Because `settings.json` references `.claude/scripts/session-setup.sh` and
Lola installs the *other* scripts, `session-setup.sh` itself must exist
before Lola runs — it cannot be installed by Lola. This is the bootstrap
script that installs everything else.

The canonical copy lives at `scripts/session-setup.sh` in the repo root.
Each workflow commits a **plain copy** (not a symlink) at
`.claude/scripts/session-setup.sh`. Symlinks don't survive hydrate.sh's
subpath extraction (`cp -r` preserves the symlink but the target is
discarded with the parent directories).

A CI check validates that workflow copies stay in sync with the canonical
script:

```bash
diff scripts/session-setup.sh workflows/quay/.claude/scripts/session-setup.sh
diff scripts/session-setup.sh workflows/clair/.claude/scripts/session-setup.sh
```

### ACP Session Wiring

```yaml
activeWorkflow:
  gitUrl: https://github.com/quay/ai-helpers.git
  branch: main
  path: workflows/quay

repos:
  - url: https://github.com/quay/quay.git
    branch: master
```

At session start:

1. `hydrate.sh` clones ai-helpers, extracts `workflows/quay/` subpath →
   `/workspace/workflows/quay/` (CWD). Only the subpath contents are
   extracted — parent directories (`plugins/`, `scripts/`) are discarded.
2. `hydrate.sh` clones quay/quay → `/workspace/repos/quay/`
3. Claude reads `.claude/settings.json` → discovers hooks
4. `SessionStart` hook runs `.claude/scripts/session-setup.sh` (committed):
   a. Runs `uvx --python 3.13 --from lola-ai lola sync` → fetches plugins
      from git URLs in `.lola-req`, installs skills/scripts/commands
   b. Validates install succeeded (checks `.claude/skills/` is populated)
   c. Standard bootstrap (pre-commit, gh auth, etc.)
5. Claude discovers skills from `.claude/skills/`, reads `CLAUDE.md` →
   follows reference to `/workspace/repos/quay/AGENTS.md`

### Customization via Environment Variables

Instead of forking skills with hardcoded values, set env vars in
`.ambient/ambient.json`:

| Variable | Value | Used by |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `JIRA_DOMAIN` | `redhat.atlassian.net` | jira-ops.sh, jira skill |
| `JIRA_PROJECTS` | `PROJQUAY,QUAYIO` | detect-jira-ticket.sh |
| `PR_TITLE_PATTERN` | `^(?:PROJQUAY\|QUAYIO\|NO-ISSUE):...` | enforce-pr-skill.sh |
| `DEFAULT_REPO` | `quay/quay` | check-ci.sh, poll-pr.sh |
| `JIRA_TARGET_VERSION_FIELD` | `customfield_10855` | jira-ops.sh |
| `PRIMARY_BRANCH` | `master` | start, pr skills |
| `REVIEW_TEAM` | `@quay/downstream` | poll-pr.sh |

The plugins already support most of these. The remaining hardcoded values
need to be converted to env vars as part of the migration.

### What Stays in quay/quay

| Asset | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Documents the codebase — changes with the code |
| `agent_docs/*.md` | Area-specific docs (api, database, testing, etc.) |
| `web/AGENTS.md` | Frontend docs |

These are **code documentation**, not agent infrastructure.

### What Moves to ai-helpers

| Asset | Destination |
|-------|-------------|
| `.claude/settings.json` | `workflows/quay/.claude/settings.json` |
| `.claude/skills/pilot-update/` | `workflows/quay/skills/pilot-update/` |
| `.claude/scripts/resolve-github-user.sh` | `workflows/quay/scripts/` |
| `.claude/user-map.yaml` | `workflows/quay/.claude/user-map.yaml` |
| `.ambient/ambient.json` | `workflows/quay/.ambient/ambient.json` |
| `.ambient/rubric.md` | `workflows/quay/.ambient/rubric.md` |

All shared skills/scripts/commands are **removed** from quay/quay — they're
installed from plugins via Lola at session start.

## Alternatives Considered

### APM (microsoft/apm)

APM offers a lock file (`apm.lock.yaml` with SHA pinning), native Claude Code
hook integration (auto-generates `settings.json`), security scanning, and
broader multi-agent support. However, APM requires restructuring the plugin
layout:

- Scripts must move from `scripts/` to `hooks/scripts/` with a `hooks.json`
  manifest
- Commands must be renamed from `.md` to `.prompt.md` with frontmatter
- Templates have no native deployment mechanism

This restructuring **breaks compatibility with `claude plugin add`**. Since
our plugins serve both ACP workflows (via Lola) and individual developers
(via Claude's native plugin system), maintaining both installation paths is
a hard requirement. APM's layout is incompatible with Claude's plugin
conventions.

If Lola adds lock file support in the future, or if Claude's plugin system
evolves to align with APM's conventions, this decision can be revisited.

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Env var portability

Audit all plugins and ensure every project-specific value is externalized via
env var with a sensible default. The six customized skills and six customized
scripts need their hardcoded values replaced.

### Phase 2: Create `workflows/quay/`

1. Create the directory structure shown above
2. Move quay-specific files from quay/quay
3. Create `.lola-req` referencing all four plugins
4. Create `CLAUDE.md` with `@/workspace/repos/quay/AGENTS.md` reference
5. Verify `lola sync` installs all plugins correctly

### Phase 3: Validate with ACP session

1. Spin up a test session with `activeWorkflow.path = workflows/quay`
2. Attach quay/quay as a repo
3. Run a full dev cycle: `/start` → `/code` → `/pr` → `/poll`
4. Verify all hooks fire, skills resolve, docs load

### Phase 4: Switch over

1. Update the quay ACP agent config to use ai-helpers as the workflow repo
2. Remove `.claude/` from quay/quay (PR to quay/quay)
3. Update any CI that references `.claude/` paths

### Phase 5: Onboard other projects

```bash
# Example: adding clair
mkdir -p workflows/clair/.claude/scripts
# Symlink the shared bootstrap script
ln -s ../../../scripts/session-setup.sh workflows/clair/.claude/scripts/session-setup.sh
# Declare plugin dependencies (git URLs required — see Resolved Q1/Q3)
cat > workflows/clair/.lola-req << 'EOF'
https://github.com/quay/ai-helpers.git --module-content=plugins/dev
https://github.com/quay/ai-helpers.git --module-content=plugins/jira-planning
EOF
cat > workflows/clair/CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
@/workspace/repos/clair/AGENTS.md
EOF
# Configure ACP: activeWorkflow.path = workflows/clair
```

## Resolved Questions

1. **hydrate.sh subpath extraction** — Investigated in the ACP platform
   source. `hydrate.sh` clones the full repo to a temp directory, then
   `cp -r` copies **only the subpath** (`workflows/quay/`) to
   `/workspace/workflows/quay/`. Parent directories are discarded. This
   means relative paths like `../../plugins/dev` in `.lola-req` won't
   resolve at runtime. **Resolution:** use git URLs with `--module-content`
   syntax in `.lola-req` (see [Plugin Composition](#plugin-composition)).

3. **Lola relative path support** — Tested with Lola v0.4.4. Relative
   paths in `.lola-req` do **not** work — they're treated as module names,
   not filesystem paths. `lola mod add ../../path` works (resolves against
   cwd), but `lola sync` reading from `.lola-req` does not. `file://` URLs
   also fail. **Resolution:** use git URLs with `--module-content` syntax.
   This also sidesteps the hydrate.sh subpath issue (Q1).

5. **settings.json bootstrap** — `settings.json` references
   `.claude/scripts/session-setup.sh` as a `SessionStart` hook, but Lola
   installs scripts at runtime. If `session-setup.sh` itself were installed
   by Lola, it couldn't call `lola sync` — circular dependency.
   **Resolution:** `session-setup.sh` is the bootstrap script. It is
   committed directly (symlinked from `scripts/session-setup.sh` in the
   repo root) and present before Lola runs. It calls `lola sync` to install
   everything else, then validates the install succeeded by checking that
   `.claude/skills/` is populated.

## Open Questions

1. **Python 3.13 in runner image** — Lola requires Python 3.13. Current
   sessions have `uvx` available which can auto-fetch it. Need to confirm this
   works reliably in the runner image, or add Python 3.13 to the image.

2. **Git dirty state from lola sync** — `lola sync` writes files to `.claude/`
   at runtime, creating uncommitted changes. Options:
   - Add `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/scripts/`, `.claude/commands/`,
     `.claude/templates/` to `.gitignore`
   - Accept the dirty state (session state is ephemeral)
   - Pre-install in CI and commit the result (eliminates runtime dependency)

## Benefits

- **Single source of truth** for all agent infrastructure across the quay org
- **Dual distribution** — plugins work via both `claude plugin add` and Lola
- **Automatic updates** — plugin improvements flow to all workflows
- **Clean separation** — code repos carry only code and documentation
- **Easy onboarding** — new project workflow = directory + `.lola-req` + env vars
- **Composable** — each workflow picks only the plugins it needs
- **Testable** — plugin changes can be tested against all workflows in CI
- **Red Hat aligned** — Lola is maintained by Red Hat Product Security
